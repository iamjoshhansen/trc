	<h3>What We Believe</h3>
	<h4>Doctrinal Statement</h4>
	<p>
		In order to have a healthy community, it is important that we are all hanging onto the same foundational beliefs. That is not to say that we all must believe the exact same way, 
		but that we must own the same core beliefs. Our doctrinal statement is an outline of those core beliefs at Two Rivers Church.
	</p>
	<h4>Core Values</h4>
	<p>
		As a community, we hold fast to a set of core values. Through these values, we find ourselves all facing the same direction and pursuing each other in unity!
